# To-do list

## Conversion from circuit to hypernet

* Actually make sure all circuit elements can be converted
	* Links still have problems

## Visualisation

* ~Deal with trace better (use very small invisible nodes)~
* Colours for special morphisms

## Reductions

* Implement a graph rewrite system

## Interface

* Ability to directly download circuit svgs
* Make it look prettier

## Possible future?

* Tikz generator?
