# To-do list

## Conversion from circuit to hypernet

* Actually make sure all circuit elements can be converted

## Visualisation

* Deal with trace better (use very small invisible nodes)
* Colours for special morphisms

## Reductions

* Implement a graph rewrite system

## Possible future?

* Tikz generator?
